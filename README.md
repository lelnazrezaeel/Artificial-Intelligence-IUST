### Project0
- Description: Project 0 includes Python setup instructions, workflow examples, and a mini-Python tutorial.
- Code: [Link to Project0](https://github.com/lelnazrezaeel/Artificial-Intelligence-IUST/tree/main/Class%20Activities/Project0)

### Project1
- Description: In this project, our Pacman agent navigates mazes to reach specific locations and collect food efficiently, covering DFS, BFS, Uniform Cost, and A* Search.
- Code: [Link to Project1](https://github.com/lelnazrezaeel/Artificial-Intelligence-IUST/tree/main/Class%20Activities/Project1)

### Project2
- Description: Design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. This project includes the implementation of both minimax and expectimax search algorithms.
- Code: [Link to Project2](https://github.com/lelnazrezaeel/Artificial-Intelligence-IUST/tree/main/Class%20Activities/Project2)

### Project3
- Description: In Project3, I implemented value iteration and Q-learning, testing the agents on Gridworld, applying them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler), and utilizing them for Pacman in game scenarios.
- Code: [Link to Project3](https://github.com/lelnazrezaeel/Artificial-Intelligence-IUST/tree/main/Class%20Activities/Project3)

### Project4
- Description: In this project, I designed Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. The project advances from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.
